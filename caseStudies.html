        <p>Carnelian Water Services is a site for my Dad&apos;s new company. He is offering the service of providing salt pallets to replace the used ones for people&apos;s salt water softening system.</p>
        <p>In November 2022, the project needed to happen to publicize my Dad&apos;s new water softening company online. He will be able to use QR codes to share his site quickly and easily. It needs to show what services he provides at what cost.</p>
        <p>The user of his website would be the old woman who doesn&apos;t have the strength to lift the heavy salt pallets alone. It could also be the dad who wants a break from the arduous task of replacing salt pallets.</p>
        <p>I coded the website and came up with some of the design ideas. My cousin Brett was the graphic designer and made the logo and an idea of what the home page of the website would look like.</p>

        <img src="images/CWSsite.png" alt="CWS website">
        <p>My dad needed me to get the site done before late December so he could publicize his services as a potential Christmas gift. I also was very overwhelmed and busy with my classes at the time. I also had never coded a website for a company before and my skills only include coding in HTML, CSS, and a tiny but of JavaScript at that point.</p>
        <p>First I went over the site and company idea with my dad. I got clarity on what he wanted to get out of having a website and who his ideal customer was. We then did some sketches together to map out the information hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Next I communicated with my cousin Brett, the graphic designer for this project, to see what kind of design, font, and color scheme he was going for. After that I started coding the site. I used examples of other sites for good navigation design, FAQ designs, and pricing table designs. In the end the site was ready to deploy to its already purchased domain. I even helped my dad make flyers with the site QR code.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately my dad hasn&apos;t moved forward with his business with great effort yet. He had some additional tweaks he wanted to make to the site, but overall it&apos;s a very functional and visually pleasing site. He has plans to work with a UVU student to get his marketing going for the company within the next semester of Fall 2023.</p>

        <h2>Action For Healthy Kids</h2>
        <p>For my DGM 1230 class we were instructed to find a non-profit website that needs some work and redesign it. I am personally passionate about the importance of mental and physical health. I know exercise and proper nutrition helps people feel better in life in every way. Ironically, I am staying up all night to finish this website, but that's besides the point haha.</p>
        <p>Because I am passionate about building healthy habits I found a non-profit site that seemed it could do a great deal of good, yet needed a revamp. The site I decided is for an organization called "Action For Healthy Kids", aka AFHK, and here is the link to their site.</p>
        <p>Some issues I found were that the site was very overwhelming, many links didn't work, the site wasn't as responsive as I would like, and the navigation was very confusing and problematic.</p>
        <img src="images/AFHKogSite.png" alt="Original AFHK website">
        <p>Above take a look at the screenshots of the site at first glance, and the site navigation. Pretty confusing and overwhelming right? To organize my understanding of how to best reorganize the AFHK site I created a drawn sitemap of where all the links led to and were organized. See below for visual.</p>
        <img src="images/AFHKsiteMap.png" alt="Site Map of AFHK website">
        <p>Next, I created wireframe sketches of how I wanted to layout the information for the organization in a simpler, more concise way. I wanted the site to be cute and kid-friendly, yet still engaging for adults. I didn't design for every single route that the AFHK site had, especially considering some of the links led nowhere, but I tried to include the basic beginnings of what would be necessary for the site to be less confusing on first view and click.</p>

        <img src="images/AFHKsketchnote2.png" alt="Sketchnote for AFHK website">
        <p>After that I created basic digital wireframes to make more clear what I wanted the site to be online, rather than just on paper. To start, I kept the wireframe in black and white to focus on the layout, rather than the color scheme. These wireframes were created for the 3 different media query sizes: mobile, tablet, and desktop.</p>
        <img src="images/AFHKwireframes.png" alt="Wireframe for AFHK website">
        <p>Finally, I created a pattern library, a final wireframe, and a prototype that would allow you to simulate if the website were coded using Adobe XD's prototype feature!</p>

        <p>In the end I coded parts of the site, but adjusted it to meet the requirements of the final capstone assignment for my DGM 2740 Class.</p>

        <h2>UVU's Registrar's Website</h2>
        <p>The UVU Registrar is an office that deals with UVU&apos;s Graduation, Registration, and Transfer Credit. They need the site redesigned and our DGM 2240 class is taking that task on in groups.</p>
        <p>The Registrar&apos;s site needed to be redesigned to have greater consistency across pages, greater functionality, and better and clearer access to the customer service provided by the Registrar&apos;s Office.</p>
        <img src="images/UVURsurvery.png" alt="Survey and Personas for UVU Registrar Office">
        <p>The user of the site would mostly be a UVU student, whether one that is graduating, registering for classes, or transferring to or from UVU. The audience may also include parents helping their kids who are going to college and counselors for other colleges or for UVU.</p>
        <p>I worked with a team of five to conduct UX research on how to improve the Registrar&apos;s Office site.</p>
        <p>The limiting factors are that those working on the UX research are students who are only available for the duration of the DGM 2240 class an$ the framework in which the UVU website is within.</p>
        <p>We started by interviewing our stakeholders about what they wanted. We then user surveys, one on one interviews, and eye-tracking research. Additionally, we selected design principles, made storyboards, made provisional personas, and made plans of what would best suit the user in the redesign. We also presented to our stakeholders, made wireframes and surface comps to show what the website could end up like.</p>

        <img src="images/UVURscenarioStoryboard.png" alt="Scenario Storyboard for UVU Registrar Office">
        <p>In the end we gleaned lots of valuable input from our research. We realized that users weren&apos;t able to access the Registrar&apos;s Office from UVU&apos;s homepage. Our surface compositions were the accumulation of all our research to result in how we believed the Registrar&apos;s site should be redesigned. They had the option to use our designs if they desired.
